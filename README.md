# Tax Proposal Calculator: Program to determine how much a taxpayer would pay.

A state legislator is proposing a major reform of the state income tax code, with a provision to incentivize working as a nurse or a teacher. Your job is to write a program that determines how much a taxpayer would pay under the plan.
According to the plan:

The first $55000 of taxable income is taxed at 4%.
The next $70000 of taxable income is taxed at 7% in general. However, if the taxpayer's occupation is nurse or teacher (so spelled, entirely in lower case), the income in this bracket is taxed at only 5%.
The amount of taxable income that exceeds $125000 is taxed at 9.3%.
If the taxable income is under $125000, the tax is reduced by $200 per child; however, the tax is never allowed to go below zero. if this would cause the tax to be negative, then the tax is zero instead.

The program is made to be easily edited to fit other income brackets and tax percentages.
